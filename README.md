This is a program made with **Java** to help you organize your messy folder of pictures and videos. Developed for the **Linux**, **Windows** and **MacOS** operating systems.

It has three features:
  . Delete empty sub-folders
  . Recursevily detect if you have duplicated photos. You will be able to choose wich ones you want to keep and wich ones you don't. Also you will be able to choose the percentage of equality of the photos you want the program to detect. About the videos, for now it will only detect duplicated videos with 100% match of equality.
  . Organize your files by year, using the date the photo was taken, but keeps them organized like you did.

Pre-Requisites
------------------

. You will need to be running a Linux operating system.

. You will need to have **Java SDK** installed.
For Ubuntu distros users:
```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```
For MacOS users:
If you don't have **brew** installed, install it by:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 
```
To install Java:
```
brew install java11
```
```
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
